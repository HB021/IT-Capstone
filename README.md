# IT-Capstone Project    
This repository explores the step by step development of a prototype of an AI model that predicts a dropout rate of students trying to major in  certain subject. Note: The dataset is a sample dataset that is generated using statistical figure. Therefore, we do not expect the result to be accurate with the general population.
